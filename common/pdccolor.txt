   The VT,  WinGUI,  and (eventually) SDL2,  SDL1,  and X11 models all
have the ability to support 'full' RGB,  16 million colors.  ncurses
currently supports this with the xterm-direct model,  in which you
get 2^24 colors and can't change them.

   The slight problem with this is that it breaks existing palette-based
code.  I've found a few people complaining about this.  It's true
that one should not blindly assume you'll have a color palette and
can change it.  There's no promise of that sort in Curses.  The
can_change_color() function exists for good reason.  (The Linux
console is a good example of a place where you can't change colors.)

   However... I've written code that assumes you can change the color.
I think a lot of people do.  If somebody complains that it doesn't
work in the Linux console,  we say : "Don't do that."

   I have a workaround that should allow existing code to work "as
usual",  adds the 16-million colors,  and doesn't require much code
or memory.

   'pdccolor.c' continues to have the traditional basic 256 colors :
8 primary colors,  8 "intensified" primary colors,  a 6x6x6=216
color cube,  and 24 shades of gray.  This is followed by 2^24
colors,  so COLORS = 2^24 + 2^8.  By default,  palette indices past
256 have color components

r =  (index - 256) & 0xff
g = ((index - 256) >> 8) & 0xff
b = ((index - 256) >> 16) & 0xff

   The first 256 colors are handled as they were before : at
initialization, a PDC_rgbs[] array is allocated and the palette
filled in.   RGB values for "upper" (palette index >= 256) values are
stored in a PDC_rgb_cube triple-pointer array,  with a given RGB
value stored at PDC_rgb_cube[b][g][r], with r, g, b computed as above
from the index.

   However,  no memory is ever computed for PDC_rgb_cube until it's
actually needed.  If a color is requested from the "upper" values and
PDC_rgb_cube,  or PDC_rgb_cube[b], or PDC_rgb_cube[b][g],  have not
been allocated,  we just return the default color. Conveniently, that
returned color works out to be idx-256 when expressed as a 24-bit
packed RGB value.

   If set_palette_entry() is called for an "upper" value,  we allocate
PDC_rgb_cube if necessary;  PDC_rgb_cube[b] if necessary;  and
PDC_rgb_cube[b][g] if necessary,  filling it with the default values.

   The vast majority of programs which either never use color
indices past 256,  or which decide to use them at the default values,
will never cause PDC_rgb_cube to be allocated.  If you decide to
use a palette of,  say,  1024 colors,  then PDC_rgb_cube,
PDC_rgb_cube[0],  and PDC_rgb_cube[0][0...3] will be allocated.
That comes to four arrays of 256 colors plus two arrays of 256
pointers.  So I don't think this will be a memory hog.

   NOTE,  though,  that some steps remain for 'proper' use of
full-color RGB :

   -- With 32-bit chtypes,  you only can have 256 color pairs.  So
you can have full RGB for up to 256 characters.  After that,  you'd
better need a color pair you've already used.  Solution is to use
64-bit chtypes (which are needed for full Unicode support and other
desirable functions anyway).

   -- It'd be a fine thing to have,  say,  64K color pairs.  But we'd
probably want to make it as memory-frugal as the above scheme for the
color palette,  and probably would do it in the same way : 256 color
pairs would be allocated by default,  with more only allocated if we
actually need them.  (64K color pairs ought to be enough for anybody,
it seems to me... I'm open to counter-arguments.)

   -- We'll need to add init_extended_pair,  init_extended_color,
extended_color_content,  and extended_pair_content,  a la ncurses...

http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/init_extended_color.3x.html

   ...for exactly the same reason ncurses needed them : without them,
we can't access palette entries or color pairs beyond the range of a
signed short integer.
