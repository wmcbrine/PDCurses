            (Public Domain Curses for DOS, OS/2, X11 and Win32)


INTRODUCTION:

This release of PDCurses includes the following changes:

BUGS FIXED:
- Allow accented characters on Win32 platform when run on non-English keyboards.
- Allow "special" characters like Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Q under OS/2 to be returned.
- Some bugs with halfdelay() principally on DOS fixed by William McBrine.
- pechochar() should now work correctly.
- redrawwin() macro in curses.h was incorrect - fixed by Alberto Ornaghi
- Don't include "special" characters like KEY_SHIFT_L to be returned in getnstr()
  family.
- Entering TAB in wgetnstr() no longer exceeds requested buffer size.
  Also beep() called when buffer exceeded. Bug 562041.
- Reverse video of X11 selection reinstated. Pablo Garcia Abio??
- Right Alt modifier now works like left Alt modifier under Win32
- Add support for all libXaw replacement libraries with Scrollbar bug. Note
  that for this to work, you still have to change the libXaw replacement
  libraries to fix the bug :-(

  by Frank Heckenbach.

  - Missing panel_hidden() prottype. Bug 649320.

  details were being lost.

NEW FEATURES:
- Clipboard support now available on DOS platform, but handled internally to the
  currently running process.
- new X11 resource; textCursor, allows the text cursor to be specified as a vertical
  bar, or in the standard horizontal bar. Thanks to Frank Heckenbach for the
  suggestion.
